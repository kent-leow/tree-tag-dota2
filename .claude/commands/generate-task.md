description: "Generate or refine task-NNN.md files. Auto-detects mode: no task files exist → generate from plan.md; task files exist or task-NNN.md path provided → refine. Triggers: generate tasks, ready to implement, break down plan, generate subtasks, update task, add task, change implementation detail, correct file path, adjust slice."
tools: [read, search, edit, execute, todo]
argument-hint: "Generate: provide path to plan.md. Refine: provide path to task-NNN.md and your corrections."
---

**Input**: `plan.md` path (Generate) or `task-NNN.md` path + changes (Refine). **Output**: `task-NNN.md` file(s) in same `.docs/<folder>/` — each self-contained, independently testable vertical slices.

## Mode Detection

| Condition | Mode |
|---|---|
| `plan.md` path given AND no `task-*.md` exist in that folder | **Generate** |
| `task-NNN.md` path + corrections, OR task files exist and user provides changes | **Refine** |

## Generate Mode

Stop if `plan.md` has unresolved blocking Open Questions — tell user to resolve first.

**Codebase Exploration** (scope to areas plan touches):
- File structure, naming, folder conventions
- Backend: controller/service/repository/DTO/entity patterns
- Frontend: module/component/service/routing patterns
- Test locations (unit + integration)
- Shared utilities, validators, constants to reuse

**Slice Design**:
- Each slice: complete, runnable, independently testable
- Don't split if both halves can't be tested in isolation
- Typical seams: data layer → service+API → frontend → e2e
- Target ~half-day to two-day effort per slice

**Template**:
```md
# Task NNN — <Slice Title>

## Goal
One sentence: what this slice delivers and how to verify it.

## Prerequisites
- [ ] task-NNN.md completed (or "None")

## Tasks

### <Layer Name>

- [ ] `path/to/file.ext` — <what to create or change> (new)
  - [ ] `path/to/file.spec.ext` — <behaviours: happy path, validation, auth, edge cases>

> One `### Layer` per logical layer. Every logic file MUST have a test child. Pure config/barrel: no test needed.

## Done When
- [ ] <Observable condition>
- [ ] All new and modified tests pass
- [ ] No existing tests broken
```

**Content Rules**:
- Paths: repo-root-relative; mark new `(new)`; use `<TBD: description>` if unknown — never guess
- Task entries: one per file; name method/behaviour specifically
- Tests: indented child per logic file; happy path, validation failure, auth failure, edge cases
- Done When: observable without reading code; mirrors plan AC
- Never overwrite existing task file — create new numbered one

After generating, reply:
```
Generated <N> task(s) in .docs/<folder>/:
  task-001.md — <summary>
```

## Refine Mode

1. Read task file and sibling `plan.md`. Search codebase for unfamiliar paths before editing.
2. Apply changes per table below. Touch only what changed.
3. Verify all logic tasks have test children and Done When still reflects tasks.
4. Append `## Changelog`: `- YYYY-MM-DD: <summary>`. Save.

| Change | Action |
|---|---|
| File path correction | Update task checkbox + test checkbox |
| Added task | Insert in correct `### Layer`; add test checkbox |
| Removed task | Delete task + test checkbox; adjust Done When if affected |
| Logic description update | Rewrite only affected line |
| New test coverage | Add indented child under relevant task |
| New file group | Add `### Layer` section with tasks and tests |
| Re-slice | Update this file; note other task file also affected |

**Consistency Check** (flag — don't auto-fix unless unambiguous):

| Check | Pass if |
|---|---|
| No orphaned tests | Every test checkbox has parent task |
| No logic task without test | Every logic file has test child |
| Prerequisites accurate | Listed prior task files exist in same folder |
| Done When covers goal | Goal and Done When aligned |
| No duplicate tasks | Same file not listed twice |

## Constraints
- No code — describe what to write, not the code itself
- No invented files or patterns absent from codebase or plan
- Every logic change must have a test task — no exceptions
- Each task file self-contained; no duplicate tasks across files
- Modify only affected sections when refining; never rewrite entire file
- Never merge/split slices unless explicitly asked
